<p>I’m stuck</p>

<p>I like writing things, I like making things. At least I’m pretty sure
 I do. I want to write stuff, stories and essays and articles, and put 
them out into the world. I want to make games and clothes and cute 
little odds and ends. At least, I think I do.</p>

<p>But I’m not doing that, am I. I’m stuck.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I sat down to write intentionally. Ideas 
come, moments of inspiration hit me, but they don’t translate onto the 
page. The bounce around my skull for a while, I sit, I turn them over, 
sometimes I even make notes. But that’s as far as it goes. And when I 
have managed to sit down and write, to make something, it’s rare I get 
very far.</p>

<p>Back around christmas I tried to get out some thoughts I had around 
queer theory, about gender and society and transfemininity. I wrote some
 stuff, a little under 3000 words, I showed it to a few friends as a 
draft to tidy up and incorporate some of their feedback into. I read 
some stuff that they recommended to me, made some edits, more or less 
completely rewrote it. And then more or less completely rewrote it 
again. And then just sort of… lost steam. And I never put it into the 
world, I showed a dozen or so people the 3000 words of my first attempt 
to really put those ideas coherently into writing, and that was it.</p>

<p>That’s not really an outlier, it’s how I go with a lot of my writing,
 fiction and non-fiction. Endlessly rewriting and editing, getting stuck
 tweaking the same little bits over and over. I’ve tried to write 
long-ish form ficiton, but it’s rare I manage to write more than three 
or for chapters before I get stuck in the cycle of tweaking and 
tinkering until I drift off to something else. I’ve tried to write short
 form stuff, but it always either feels to insubstantial or doesn’t stay
 short form.</p>

<p>I’m stuck.</p>

<p>Do I even like making things? Do I even really want to? Do I actually
 have it in me to see anything through, to actually make anything at 
all? I try and I try but my brain always just… glances off. I get drawn 
back into the same cycles of re-doing the same bits over and over and 
over and over, forward progess getting slower and slower until 
eventually I have not passion or drive or interest left to keep me 
going. Except for those times, those few tantalising, terrible times, 
when the madness takes hold and the obsession takes me for days. Except 
even then I’m stuck, eventually I hit the wall and I stumble out the 
other side with nothing coherent to show for it, to exhausted and broken
 to even bring myself to look at what I’ve half-made.</p>

<p>And so, I’m stuck. Stuck failing to make art, make anything. And now,
 I can’t even bring myself to start any more. I know how it’ll go, just 
another dead project, discarded too rough and incomplete to do anything 
with, but too much there for me to just let it completely rest either. 
Even now they call to me, the ghosts of projects I left to die.</p>

<p>But I’m stuck.</p>

<p>Which brings me here, writing this. Writing with intentionality 
again. Being wierd and fucky and raw and kind of autobiographical about 
it. Metawriting, writing about writing about writing. Deliberately 
pouring out a stream of conciousness because I’m stuck on it. See what I
 did there, that witty little bit of reframing and restructuring. It’s 
so small, nothing all that special, but it’s the kind of cute cleverness
 I enjoy a lot, a statement that you can sort of stumble into and find 
meaning there. It’s hard, holding back the instinct to edit, to try to 
make the rest of this tighter and cleverer, to tinker till it’s full of 
cleverness like that, imbue a clear powerful vision tying it together. 
But I won’t, I mustn’t let myself, because then I’ll get sucked in, get 
lost in it, get stuck again.</p>

<p>But I digress, I’m here, writing this, writing with intentionality. 
Not the kind of writing I normally do, but that’s why this is probably 
going to go somewhere and the rest isn’t. Messy on purpose, rough and 
raw and half-formed, because anything more than that is too much. I 
don’t like that about myself, I have so many ideas I want to share and 
stories I want to tell and things I want to create. But I never do, I 
just get stuck. Something in my soul hungers for it, craves creation and
 artistry and all the rest, but it’s never borne out. So now I’m just 
adrift, sorrowful at what I’ve failed to do, who I’ve failed to be. I 
don’t know how to change it, part of me wants to think that by writing 
this I can move the needle, shift myself toward a better way of thinking
 about writing, approaching writing, approaching programming, 
approaching creation in general. Fix whatever it is that stops me 
finishing. But in truth I doubt it, I’ll finish typing this out, go and 
slap it somewhere, go do something else, and then slip back into my old 
patterns.</p>

<p>Because I’m stuck. And I don’t know how to not be.</p>
